  Paper #319: Hazelnut: A Bidirectionally Typed Structure Editor Calculus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Overall merit: A. Good paper, I will champion it
                         Confidence: Y. I am knowledgeable in this area,
                                        but not an expert

                         ===== Paper summary =====

This paper presents a type theory of structure editing with many holes, and
one cursor like a zipper. Semantically, the calculus formalizes "squiggly
lines" so that temporary inconsistencies are delimited in holes instead of
rendering the entire program meaningless. The calculus enables rich editing
with deferred consistency checks and furthermore not limited to just
outside-in tree-like editing. In addition to a model, the paper includes
theorems -- in particular, the sensibility theorem establishes that the
edit state is well-typed after cursor erasure. The paper also discusses
safe extension and relations to known type theories.

Formally, an `HTyp` adds an extra syntactic form for a hole. An `HExp` adds
likewise an extra syntactic form for a hole, and in addition for a
non-empty expression hole. A non-empty expression hole erases to an empty
hole for the purpose of typing. `ZTyp` and `ZExp` adds a notion of cursor
within types and expressions, respectively. Semantic actions are defined by
relative movements on Z-expressions.

                           ===== Strengths =====

+ beautiful typesetting, with tasteful use of colors
+ paper is easy to read in order, flows well
+ thoughtful about proving theorems that are relevant to semantic editing

                          ===== Weaknesses =====

- the paper does not have a practical evaluation, though it seems OK to me
  to leave this as future work

                      ===== Comments for author =====

The paper presents a foundation of semantics for editing. Because the paper
is well-structured and written, this is a valuable contribution that others
can build on.

  Paper #319: Hazelnut: A Bidirectionally Typed Structure Editor Calculus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Overall merit: B. OK paper, but I will not champion
                                        it
                         Confidence: X. I am an expert in this area

                         ===== Paper summary =====

This paper introduces Hazelnut, which the authors describe as a
“type-theoretic structure editor calculus” for a very simply lambda
calculus.  The paper defines the notion of expressions and types with holes
and then adds the notion of a cursor a la Huet’s zippers.  The authors give
a language of commands for moving the cursor and filling it with constructs
from the language.  They give a bi-directional type system for the language
and show the resulting system has a number of nice theoretical properties
including:

 1) Sensibility (Actions on well-typed terms produce well-typed terms under
 both type analysis and type checking),

 2) Movement erasure (moving the cursor around types and expressions does
 not change their erased values),

 3) Reachability (the movement commands can move the cursor anywhere in an
 expression or type), and

 4) Constructabilty (any expression or type can be constructed using the
 commands in the language).

Most of these results have been proven formally in Agda.  The authors show
the essentially routine process of extending the original language with the
constructs necessary to support binary sums.  The goal of the paper is to
provide a formal semantics for structured editors.  The authors envision
multiple possible front ends with a variety of user interfaces.

                           ===== Strengths =====

+ Mechanized semantics and proofs of Sensibility and Movement Invariance in
Agda and is available in supplement.

+ Reference implementation exists and is available in supplement.

+ Lots of interesting relationship with existing work (gradual type
systems, type holes as unification variables, type-directed program
synthesis, contextual modal type theory/interleaved “edit and resume”
programming)

+ Clearly written paper.

+ The idea of automatically generating much of the structure seems feasible
and really useful.

                          ===== Weaknesses =====

- Not clear how usable/useful structure editors are.
- Proofs of reachability and constructabilty have not yet been fully mechanized.

                      ===== Comments for author =====

I like the discussion of how the various theorems ensure that the rules you
have defined are correct and that you have not forgotten any.

I like how you showed how to extend the system with a new kind of type,
giving a feel for the level of effort required to handle new constructs.

Neural implants: programming at the speed of thought :-)!… although having
to think all the shape commands to navigate would quickly become tedious!

Conceptual questions
p. 5 Do you need actions for renaming bound variables?

p. 6 The deletion rule for Z-expressions in analysis changes not just the
expression being deleted but also the inferred type.  Does this “action
outside the hole” cause any difficulties?

p. 6 Rule (10a) Why does the construct arrow make the type at the cursor
location into the argument type?  Why not the result type?  Why not have
two commands for introducing function types, one where the cursor into the
argument and a second into the return?  This approach would be consistent
with what you did for function application.

p. 7 Similarly for plus.  Why does the construct plus command put the
argument in the left hand side?  Because of the symmetry of addition?

Minor edits/confusions
p. 1 “it’s edit” —> “its edit”

p. 5 Figure 7.  It’s probably useful to “read” the cases for Shape.  It
took me a bit to decipher asc. Nehole looks like it is something you will
talk about later; maybe say that?

p. 5 “if the cursor erasure of the edit state synthesizes a type, then we
defer to the synthetic action judgement, as long as the type of the
resulting cursor erasure is consistent with the type provided for
analysis.” I don’t follow what you mean by “the resulting cursor erasure.”
It seems like that would be type \tau.’ (the type inferred for the cursor
eraser), but you are actually checking that \tau. is consistent with
\tau.’’ not \tau.’.  What am I missing?  (Sorry if that was difficult to
follow!)

p. 8 latex residual: -3px

      ===== Questions for authors to address in rebuttal period =====

p. 6 Rule (11c) Are you guaranteed in this case that x is already in the
context?  Does this mean that you have to introduce the binding location
for a variable before you can refer to the variable?  Is that overly
restrictive in practice? Why not allow holes in the context?

                         ===== Paper summary =====

This paper presents a type-based system for structured editing. Terms and
types may have holes representing unspecified or underspecified subterms
and subtypes. Holes can be empty, indicating an unspecified subterm or
subtype, or nonempty, indicating a subterm or subtype that does not (yet)
match its context. There are rules for type synthesis, or generation of a
type for a given term, and analysis, determining whether a term can appear
where an expression of a given type is expected. The system is more
flexible than other structure editors in that it allows a comparatively
liberal set of partially consistent states. There are also rules that allow
the user to incrementally develop a type or term, filling it the gaps while
maintaining partial consistency (Theorem 1), and moving a cursor
around. There is a prototype written in Agda.

                           ===== Strengths =====

- A principled type-theoretic approch to structure editing that allows a
  more flexible form of typing.

- Connections to gradual typing

- Generally well-written, although difficult to follow all the intricacies
  of the type system, especially the interaction between synthesis and
  analysis. However it seems well considered.

                          ===== Weaknesses =====

None, except for a few typos.

                      ===== Comments for author =====

I may be mistaken, but the system for navigating with the cursor seems
completely orthogonal to the type system. It also seems like it is a
special case of something much more general that would apply to any term
signature. I am wondering whether this part of the system could be factored
out and handled completely separately, independently of the type system. As
it is currently, it is like the lambda calculus with a cursor movement
system for allowing a user to navigate around to select a redex to
reduce. Perhaps it would be possible to present a cursor-free version of
the type system in which any subterm matching a rule premise can be a
redex, as in the lambda calculus. If there is some reason this is not
possible, this should be explained.

To what extent can one precompile or partially evaluate in the presence of

                         ===== Paper summary =====

This paper develops a typed programming language that features extensions
that support structure editing, as well as a theory of structured editor
actions that supports the development of syntactically well-typed programs
throughout the editing process.  This structured editing theory relies on
notions of typed expression and type holes, bidirectional typing, and
gradual type consistency to preserve typeability while supporting both
top-down and bottom-up programming within the same development.  The edit
actions are designed and validated with respect to a suite of correctness
criteria.

                           ===== Strengths =====

+ Interesting idea and execution
+ Nice set of validating metatheorems
+ Well-Written Paper

                          ===== Weaknesses =====

+ Must the source language be designed with structure editing in mind?
+ Must the source language type system be bidirectional
+ How does this scale to polymorphism, either System F or Hindley/Milner?
+ How does support incremental type and other declarations fit in?

                      ===== Comments for author =====

This is an interesting idea and I can appreciate the goals of the work.
The paper sets down a number of fine criteria and some of he basic ideas.
It could do more to talk about how these concepts apply to more complex
languages than STLC and what would be straightforward and what would not.

I'm mostly concerned by whether an existing language with its own, possibly
NOT bidirectional, syntax and type system can be enhanced into a
corresponding structure editor calculus, or is this limited to languages
designed with structure editors in mind.  The paper could speak more about
this.


The title of the paper could speak more directly to the important aspect of
the work: that it's a type-enforcing structure editor.  That it's
bidirectionally typed seems to be a mere technical detail, one tool among
many that is used in its development.


Abstract:
A nitpick, but: the "popularity" of structure editors is not "evidence" of
their cognitive benefits.  I expect there is something more precise to say
here.

"guides the definition of an extension to the calculus" say which
extension: sums.



Introduction:
"This indirection has practical benefits" say what some of those are.  That
text based tools are old is not in and of itself a benefit.  For example,
it would help me to understand what the authors might see one losing by
switching to a structure editor.


"develop ad hoc heuristics, which can be misleading."  I'm not sure what is
meant by misleading here.  A bit more about what you have in mind?

"This paper develops a principled solution."  What is the principle?  It
would be great to know up front succinctly the guiding principle, even more
than the names of the formalisms to be developed.

Thanks for explaining why Z-expressions are so named: I was going to spend
too much time figuring it out otherwise.

"much of the technical machinery needed to handle type holes coincides with
machinery developed in the study of gradual typing".  In the Related Work
section, the paper talks about replacing the hole type with unification
variables, which appears would behave very differently than type
consistency.  If the gradual typing machinery is truly needed, then would
unification work?  Or is it just that this is the machinery that happened
to be used here?  Or would both be required?

"which, by its correspondence with contextual modal logic, lays logical
foundations beneath our work."  I'm not clear on whether this is a happy
syntactic accident or whether there is a compelling connection here that
should guide the development of structure editors or has more to add.  The
related work didn't really help me with this, especially since "making the
modal context explicit in our semantics is not technically useful given our
stated purpose."  So what is useful about this?

Section 2: Regarding the "construct lam x" action, at first I found it
rather annoying that introducing a lam also introduces an ascription, and
that lambda does not have a synthesis rule.  My best guess for this design
decision is that one should usually think of the lam and ascription
together as a single expression, rather than just marking the type of the
argument, but that in some contexts you can get away with not providing an
ascription because of the demands of the context (i.e. it's a syntactic
nicety to not provide a type for your lambda).  Is that the intent?
Otherwise lambdas are the only constructor in your theory with no synthesis
rule (even injections for sums have them).

Section 3: "We are not concerned here with defining a dynamic semantics for
Hazelnut" I can imagine defining semantics for the hole-less subset, but
what would be the purpose of a dynamic semantics for the entire language?

As alluded to earlier, why not have a synthesis rule for lambda that gives
x the hole type and synthesizes the type of the body?  What goes wrong?

Is it strictly necessary to have a universal subsumption rule that works
for any expression?  This seems to cause you trouble with determinism in
3.4.1.  You may be better off proving this as an admissible rule of the
entire system rather than including it as a rule itself.  That would lead
to some restrictions on a constructor-by-constructor basis, but that seems
more fundamentally palatable to me.

I can see this being needed for some introduction rules and variables
(which synthesize by design), but I don't see why application for instance
should be subject to a subsumption rule.

Regarding actions: It seems like it could be quite useful to have a "remove
ascription" action, especially given how the "construct lam" operation
works.  Otherwise it appears that you cannot easily add a lam, then add an
application around it afterwards and then remove the ascription.

"we might make a mistake absent-mindedly", briefly lay out what kinds of
mistakes that are in mind here before diving into details.

Reachability is a nice property, but I wonder if it's possible to establish
a more "local" version of reachability.  That one may have to go all the
way up and then down in movements does not bode well for implementation.
For example, if one could characterize paths to a cursor from the top of
the program, then one could prove that the moves necessary do not have to
go higher than the shared prefix of the paths to the two positions.


Regarding Determinism, I'm not particularly happy with the solution taken
here.  Choosing "elegant" presentation of the typing rules over a semantics
for edit operations that satisfies a coherence property seems to be a turn
away from the principled approach that has been followed throughout the
rest of the paper.  I think the problem here really goes back to the
generalized subsumption rule in the source type system, which then rears
its head again in the action semantics.  I strongly encourage the authors
to reconsider.


Section 4:

Extending consistency to sums seems straightforward.  But how would this
extend to types that have binders, like recursive types or System F types?


Section 5:

"By theorem 1, the editor does not need to typecheck each edit state
(though in some of the rules..."  Is the assumption that the typing
derivations are kept around by the editor and then modified?  Or is it just
an optimization to only re-check if certain edit actions are applied?  The
edit actions appear to depend on the type derivations critically.

"We determine this by simply attempting to perform the action internally
and catching the exception..."  This is fine for a proof of concept, but
what is a practical alternative to doing this?  Do you have a sketch of
what the right thing to do would be?  e.g. could a "zipper" representation
of the typing derivation up to the cursor provide enough local information
to quickly detect (il)legal actions?


Section 6:

Related to Type Unification, can this technique scale to the Hindley-Milner
setting, or even lambda calculus without any ascriptions (as presented in
TAPL's type reconstruction chapter)?  I'm not clear on how one would
proceed.

Section 7:

The future work section seems really long and high-level.  Rather than
seeing lots of directions sparsely described, I'd like to see just a few of
them with more details about how and why they may be viable.  Should others
desire more content elsewhere, this is a good place to shrink if needed.
